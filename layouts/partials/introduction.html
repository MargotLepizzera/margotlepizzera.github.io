I'm a Product Manager. I previously helped grow <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/product/synthetic-monitoring/">Synthetics</a> and <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/product/platform/alerts/">Alerting</a> products at Datadog. I currently work as a freelance PM for a B2B e-commerce project. I am passionate about tech, feminism (don't get scared), biodiversity preservation, and books.
