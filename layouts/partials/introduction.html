I'm a Product Manager. I previously helped grow <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/product/synthetic-monitoring/">Synthetics</a> and <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/product/platform/alerts/">Alerting</a> products at Datadog. I currently work as a freelancer for a B2B e-commerce project. I care about the environment, feminism, and books.
